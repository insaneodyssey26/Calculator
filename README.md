# Basic Calculator

Welcome to the calculator app that does what you expect (and maybe a little more). No AI, no blockchain, just numbers and buttons—like the good old days, but with Kotlin and Compose.

## What can it do?

- Add, subtract, multiply, divide (the classics)
- Percent (%), plus/minus (±), square root (√), square (x²), and 1/x (for the math nerds)
- Clear and delete, because mistakes happen
- History panel so you can relive your greatest calculations
- Buttons that look the same size (finally!)
- Subtle animations and a little buzz (haptics) when you tap stuff

## How to run it

If you just want the APK, grab it from the [Releases section](https://github.com/insaneodyssey26/basic_calculator/releases) and install it on your phone. No coding required!

If you want to build it yourself:

1. Clone this repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/insaneodyssey26/basic_calculator.git
   ```
2. Open it in Android Studio.
3. Hit Run. If it doesn’t work, blame Gradle (or me).

## Where’s the code?

- `app/src/main/java/` — All the Kotlin magic
- `app/src/main/res/` — Layouts, icons, and other stuff
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — App manifest
- `build.gradle.kts` — Build config
